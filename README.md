# Yenta

Yenta is built to match students with alumni with relevant backgrounds
as part of a mentorship program.
It matches students with alumni using a variation of
the [Galeâ€“Shapley algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_marriage_problem).
Then once the preliminary matches have been computed, 
there's an opportunity for the operator to make adjustments based on attributes
that are not fully coded into the multiple choice questions.

Once the matches have been solidified, there's a script to
send personalized emails to students, notifying them of their 
new alumni mentors.

## Collecting data

Columns for `data/alumni.csv` are as follows:

- Industry
- Function
- Geography
- How many students are you willing to mentor?
- Gender
- Race / Ethnicity
- Do you identify as LGBT?
- Do have a military background?
- Do you have a joint degree?
- Have you worked in a family business?
- Is there anything else that is critically important to you?

Columns for `data/students.csv` are as follows (priorities are collected with matrix radio buttons):

- Timestamp
- First Name
- Last Name
- Email Address

- Gender
- Race / Ethnicity
- Would you prefer a mentor that is LGBT?
- Would you prefer a mentor with a military background?
